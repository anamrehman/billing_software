# Billing_Software
This software is designed to manage Quick Response Codes (QR codes) for all the items a person buys.

The primary goal of this project is to minimize paper usage by sending purchase bills directly to the customer's email address.

So, the attached image is the **GUI Interface of the Software**.

# QR Generator

We've utilized a sample input to generate a Quick Response Code for the invoice. 
Additionally, by clicking the "Generate QR" button, the system automatically captures the inputs and saves a copy of the code.
This ensures a record is maintained for future reference, particularly in cases related to the bill number.
